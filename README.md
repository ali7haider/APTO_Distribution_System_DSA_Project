# APTO_Distribution_System_DSA_Project
  - # Project Description
    There is always a constant need to improve and organize the inner work process for the
    company in an efficient manner, especially for the distribution companies because they
    have to deal with many clients or shopkeepers in many areas. To be more efficient, they
    should have records of everything. For example, they should have proper records of their
    clients who will buy the product, record of everything they buy and sell to shopkeepers to
    see how much their products are selling, how much profit they are getting, and many other
    things. Sometimes, the company also wants to do an analysis of the revenue or sales of
    its products. But these things are difficult to do manually. We aim to propose a solution
    to this problem by providing a desktop application that remodels and creates an easier way
    to assign tasks and keep track of the whole process from the order to the delivery, hence
    making analysis and keeping everything documented. The solution is the Distribution
    System. A distribution System is a system where all modules will be controlled within a
    single application. Distribution Systems are very scalable meaning more employees can
    be added if there is an increase in workload. There is no need to upgrade the application.
    Every user could have their own modules. Similarly, our project will be like this. Our
    project title will be APTO Distribution. We sell mainly Nestle Company products
    which will be beverages. In this project, there are 5 users Admin, Manager, Sales Agents,
    Delivery Employees, Order Dispatcher, and Shopkeepers will have no relation to
    the distribution application. Every user will have its module. Admin is an owner of the
    distribution company. The admin has all the privileges and visibility over all modules. He
    will have the highest priority as he is the one who hires managers and can hire other
    employees if needed. The Manager has most of the responsibilities in the system. He
    must create clients, employees, schedules, and reports. He also must always check the
    performances, and check inventory. The manager will have to assign tasks to almost
    all the Employees, Sales Agents, and Order dispatchers. The manager will also control
    the salary of employees. He will create their schedule consisting of the address the sales
    agent must attend daily. The sales agent must attend to those schedules and write a
    report on the respective situation. This report is later checked by the manager. This
    process will include scoring and daily documentation of the performance and a special
    bonus will be given which will increase the competition among sales agents and overall,
    the performance will get better. Every Sales Agent will have their own account. He will
    be responsible for taking orders from existing clients and making new clients. He must
    achieve high performance and find as many clients or shopkeepers as he can. He can get
    bonuses depending on that performance. Every sales agent will have a specific route and
    their vehicle fuel will be provided by the company. Every sales agent will use API Google map to find the shortest path to the shopkeepers to save fuel. The estimated time will
    also be calculated. After placing the order, a mail will be sent to the shopkeeper’s
    registered mail that his order is placed. This system will have an Order Dispatcher. He
    will manage the whole inventory in the warehouse and will notify the manager whenever
    a new product should be made. The order dispatcher will be responsible for calculating
    holding costs (salary of employees, rent, maintenance) versus calculating ordering costs
    (shipping). He can add or delete products and record expired products. His duties will
    be to see new orders from the clients in the system and prepare them for the Delivery
    Employee to pick them up. The delivery employee will be responsible for taking orders
    from the warehouse facility and delivering them to the corresponding addresses with the
    bill. When an order is dispatched from the warehouse, mail will be sent to the shopkeeper
    that his order is dispatched. The shopkeeper could pay the bill fully or half or could pay
    the bill later. There will be a limit to loaning a bill but after that, no orders will be taken
    from that shopkeeper until he clears his previous charges. After receiving the bill, he will
    update the info in the application and mail will be sent to the Manager. The shopkeepers
    will be the last users of the system. The shopkeeper can make an order by contacting
    its corresponding Sales Agent or when the sales agent comes to him for an order on the
    scheduled day. Admin or Manger can see daily, weekly, and monthly analyses of sales
    products and reports of sales agent’s performance. The analysis could be in graph form
    and in tabular form and it could be downloaded in PDF form. Expenses and revenue
    could be downloaded in PDF form. Admin and manager can also download CSV files of
    reports and other users’ progress data.
