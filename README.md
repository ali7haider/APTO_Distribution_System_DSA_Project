# APTO_Distribution_System_DSA_Project
  - # Project Description
  - There is always a constant need to improve and organize the inner work process for the
    company in an efficient manner, especially for the distribution companies because they
    have to deal with many clients or shopkeepers in many areas. To be more efficient, they
    should have records of everything. For example, they should have proper records of their
    clients who will buy the product, record of everything they buy and sell to shopkeepers to
    see how much their products are selling, how much profit they are getting, and many other
    things. Sometimes, the company also wants to do an analysis of the revenue or sales of
    its products. But these things are difficult to do manually. We aim to propose a solution
    to this problem by providing a desktop application that remodels and creates an easier way
    to assign tasks and keep track of the whole process from the order to the delivery, hence
    making analysis and keeping everything documented. The solution is the Distribution
    System
